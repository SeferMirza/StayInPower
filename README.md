# Welcome to Stay in Power

You have just been elected as the leader of your nation. The people have placed
their trust in you, but staying in power is no easy task. Every decision you
make will shape your country's future and determine whether you can hold onto
your positionâ€”or be voted out.

Will you balance the economy, maintain public trust, and navigate political
challenges? Or will your term be cut short by scandals, protests, or electoral
defeat?

The fate of your leadership is in your hands. Choose wisely.

**How long can you Stay in Power?**
