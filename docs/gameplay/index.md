# Gameplay

The user portrays a president who has just come to power. The objective is to make decisions, manage his relations with the sides and determine how he appears in the eyes of the public. In this way he will try to stay in power until the next election.

Each card indicates a preference. Each card selection screen represents a week. Each card will have an impact on certain sides after its selection. When your relationship with a side drops to 0, that side will have certain sanctions against you.

Some cards can initiate activities lasting longer than a week. These events will have their effect at that moment or after the end of the event. For example, the construction of a building. After the decision to build it, it will make certain people angry or happy. But also after its completion.
